# Seaborn style, color and formatting

Notes based on (and often copied-and-pasted from) the [seaborn
documentation](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn-dev/).

The best quick overview to the matplotlib API on which seaborn is based
is [Jake VanderPlas's PyData 2014
presentation](https://github.com/jakevdp/PyData2014).
